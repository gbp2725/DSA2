A1 problems
	When I try to run the program, there is an exception in a new spot every time. I don’t know what I need to fix because it will not tell me where the problem is. I also had a problem with trying to organize the queue. The problem is when I try to see whether it is a number or not, so I know how to organize it. I tried lots of different ways but could not get it to work so I commented out all my work. The last problem I had, that I could see, was that it was not printing when it should be. I made a print method and there was no error with it, but it did not print anyways. I feel like the program would work correctly if there were slight fixes where the exceptions are.
